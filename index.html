  <p2> When I was younger, my grandma would pick me up from school since my parents would be working. I would come out of school earlier than my siblings since I was still in preschool. I remember I would always be in the kitchen watching my grandma cook. One day while she was cutting some carrots, I saw something run in the living room out of the corner of my eye. I looked up for about 10 seconds and saw a boy run across the living room into my parent's room, then my brother's room, and back to my parent's room. The boy looked very pale in a white, school uniform shirt. He was wearing blue shorts and I could see blood stains on his shirt. I was in shock, but I didn't really feel scared. After I snapped out of it, I turned to look at my grandma and saw that she was also looking into the living room. I asked her if she saw the boy and she just mindlessly nodded. That was the first time I ever experienced anything like that, but it was definitely not the last.
